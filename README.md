# Take-Off

Our website aims to provide a entertaining and interesting experiences to the user regarding the topic of "Space". Our website is a kid friendly and in a sense a hub world for people to access new and exciting information regarding Space. We made this possible by intergarting NASA's API into our website, allowing for 1 click access to many interesting articles and news regarding Space. So come on! The planetary soup is stirring, what will you discover?


## Design Process

This project is for those in the general public who have an interest in space but not to the point of understanding the technical jargon. The design is simplistic and takes the data that is the flashiest and most-likely to arouse interest. This way, non-space buffs can get a taste of space (information about incoming asteroids, space news) and those who already know about space can enjoy the daily media chosen by NASA or generate something cool about space.

The project's is achieved since it is an easily accessible website, with all the information on one page, and can be used across browsers.

- As a space-obsessed person who knows a lot about space, I want to have more exposure to cool things about space.
- As someone who does not know a lot about space but wants to know some exciting information about space, I want to have some facts that serves as a conversation topic.

## Features

1. **Media of the Day**
API included| https://github.com/nasa/apod-api

This feature is the top left tile that shows the daily photo/video based on the NASA's API, it updates daily so users can check back everyday to read a new and exciting article reagrding the secrets of the cosmos.
The information included includes the actual photo/video, a title, the date that NASA has allocated it to, the copyright holders if applicable and a description of the media.
The media is chosen by NASA so it would be visually appealing and exciting from the biggest space nerd to the common man.
2. **NEO Astroid feature**
This feature shows up to 4 of the current near earth objects each from the current and next day floating around the earth? The Name, diameter, velocity and distance from earth are all listed and taken directly from NASA's API, users interested in this field will be able to get live statictics updated daily regarding near earth objects.
Clicking on each aesteroid's name would bring the user to the aesteroid's profile on the jet propulsion laboratory's website. 
This tile takes the desirable, updated information from NASA's API and displays it in a simple way.
3. **Something cool?**

4. **Spacey News**
News articles posted on Space.com will be shown here, allowing for articles to be constantly updated.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
