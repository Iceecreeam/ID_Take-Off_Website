#**Take-Off**
Our website aims to provide a entertaining and interesting experiences to the user regarding the topic of "Space". Our website is a kid friendly and in a sense a hub world for people to access new and exciting information regarding Space. We made this possible by intergarting NASA's API into our website, allowing for 1 click access to many interesting articles and news regarding Space. So come on! The planetary soup is stirring, what will you discover?



##Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
